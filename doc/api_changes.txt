1.X.Y -> 2.0.0
- removed Model::Init():
  All initialization is now done in the default constructor in Model(). To
	be compatible with the new API simply remove any calls to Model::Init().
- removed Eigen3 sources:
  Eigen3 is no more included in RBDL instead it uses the Eigen3 library
  that is installed on the system. If you want to use RBDL with Eigen3
  you have to install it on your system yourself.
- inverted sign of contact forces/impulses:
  ConstraintSet::constraint_force and ConstraintSet::constraint_impulse are
	now the forces or impulses that are acting on the constrained body by the
	constraint.

1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
- removed constructor Body (mass, com, length, gyration_radii)
  This constructor did some erroneous calculations to compute the real
	radii of gyration. It was removed as the two remaining constructors are
	properly tested and are more general.
