Changes for next version:
- added spherical joints that do not suffer from singularities:
  Use joint type JointTypeSpherical
- removed "constraint_" prefix from constraint impulses, forces and
	accelerations from the ConstraintSets:
	renaming required if values are queried	

2.0.1 -> 2.1.0
- made codebase compatible to Debian
	Binary symbol export was changed. No change in user code required,
	however everything needs to be recompiled and linked.
- Removed Lua 5.2 source
  When building the addon LuaModel, one hast to have it installed on the
	system already.
- Removed UnitTest++ sources
  When building tests one has to have it installed on the system already.

2.0.0 -> 2.0.1
- fixed compiler errors on some older compilers
  No change required when using RBDL version 2.0.0.
- fixed CMake configurations for examples
  No change required when using RBDL version 2.0.0.

1.X.Y -> 2.0.0
- removed Model::Init():
  All initialization is now done in the default constructor in Model(). To
	be compatible with the new API simply remove any calls to Model::Init().
- removed Eigen3 sources:
  Eigen3 is no more included in RBDL instead it uses the Eigen3 library
  that is installed on the system. If you want to use RBDL with Eigen3
  you have to install it on your system yourself.
- inverted sign of contact forces/impulses:
  ConstraintSet::constraint_force and ConstraintSet::constraint_impulse are
	now the forces or impulses that are acting on the constrained body by the
	constraint.

1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
- removed constructor Body (mass, com, length, gyration_radii)
  This constructor did some erroneous calculations to compute the real
	radii of gyration. It was removed as the two remaining constructors are
	properly tested and are more general.
