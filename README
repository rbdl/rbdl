RBDL - Rigid Body Dynamics Library

This code is mainly an C++ implementation of the Roy Featherstones
Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA) written by Martin Felis. The code tightly
follows the notation used in his book "Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithm".

The documentation is contained in the code and can be extracted with the
tool doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org).

To create the documentation simply run
  doxygen Doxyfile
which will generate the documentation in the subdirectory ./doc/html.
Please open ./doc/html/index.html for further information.
